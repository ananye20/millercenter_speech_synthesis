# millercenter_speech_synthesis
This project extracts and analyzes presidential speeches from the Miller Center using web scraping and NLP. It processes text for key insights, generates word clouds, and visualizes linguistic patterns.

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing presidential speeches by leveraging web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization techniques. It extracts speech transcripts from the [Miller Center](https://millercenter.org/) website, processes the text using spaCy for tokenization and stopword removal, and generates insights through word clouds and other visualization methods. The goal is to explore linguistic patterns, key themes, and trends in presidential discourse.

The tool is designed to **scrape and generate word clouds for any presidential speech from the Miller Center website**, given the URL of the speech and an image of the president. It provides insights into the speech's content by visualizing the most frequent words and themes.

## Introduction

The **Miller Center Speech Synthesis and Analysis** project is designed to analyze and visualize the content of presidential speeches. By extracting speech transcripts from the Miller Center website, the project processes the text to identify key themes, linguistic patterns, and trends. The analysis is enhanced through visualizations such as word clouds, providing a clear representation of the most frequent words and topics in presidential speeches.

The tool is flexible and can **scrape and generate word clouds for any presidential speech** from the Miller Center website, given the URL of the speech and an image of the president. This allows users to explore insights from any speech of interest.

## Technologies Used

- **Web Scraping**: 
  - `BeautifulSoup`: For parsing HTML and extracting speech transcripts.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
  - `spaCy`: For tokenization, stopword removal, and text preprocessing.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - `Matplotlib`: For creating visualizations.
  - `seaborn`: For creating visualizations.
  - `WordCloud`: For generating word clouds.
- **Text Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization and stopword removal using spaCy.
- **Other Libraries**:

## Data and Files Required
- **URL of Presidential Speech**
- **Image of President (jpg)**

---

## Usage

**Scrape Speech Data:**
Provide the URL of the presidential speech from the Miller Center website. The tool will scrape the transcript automatically.

**Provide an Image:**
Provide an image of the president (e.g., a portrait) to customize the word cloud.

**Preprocess and Analyze Text:**
The tool will clean and preprocess the text data using spaCy, including tokenization and stopword removal.

**Generate Word Cloud:**
The tool will generate a word cloud using the speech transcript and the provided image. The word cloud will highlight the most frequent words and themes in the speech.

**Explore Insights:**
Analyze the word cloud and other visualizations to identify linguistic patterns and trends in the speech.
